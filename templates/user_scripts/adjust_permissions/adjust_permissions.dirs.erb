# This is the configuration file to adjust permissions in your webdirectory.
#
# This file contains a few information about what you can do. For further
# information please have a look at: <%= @user_scripts_help %>
#
# A few things to note:
#
# 1. This config file allows two options:
#   * only_webreadable - a list of relative paths that should only be readable by
#                        the webserver 
#   * web_writable     - a list of relative paths that should be writable by the
#                        webserver
#
# 2. It must be a valid yaml file. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML for more
#    information
#
# 3. It may contain comments, a you can see here.
#
# 4. The paths must be relative to your www/ directory. We will filter out all
#    other directories and only
#    adjust permissions for paths within the www directory.
#
# 5. We will first *recursively* chown the only_webreadable paths and remove any
#    possibility to write to them via the webserver.
#    Afterwards we will *recursively* chown the web_writable paths. So one path
#    might overwrite a previous one.
#
# 4. To configure these permissions you will have to touch/create the adjust_permissions.run
#    file in this directory Once created this will trigger a run of our adjustment
#    script. Do only create the adjust_permissions.run file if you like to apply
#    your changes.
#    Usually a simple `touch scripts/adjust_permissions/adjust_permissions.run`
#    is sufficient.
#    We will remove the run file automatically if our job is done.
#
# 5. We write some logs to a logfile in the corresponding directory. It will start
#    with a timestamp, followed by the PID of the process and the actual message.
#    You might want to verify there whether your changes have been applied correctly.
#
# 6. The file *must* contain both options. If nothing should be writable by the
#    webserver, you should set it like that:
#    web_writable: []
#
# 7. If you want to manage the www/ directory itself (for example, make it writable
#    by the webserver), you can do that by including a simple . as an entry.
#    Note: the www/ directory is managed also by other scripts and as we think,
#          that having www/ writable by the webserver is a bad idea, this will
#          be reverted when these scripts run.
#
# 8. We do a lot to prevent that you can do anything nasty with that script. If
#    you find something to trick us, please let us know immediately: <%= @user_scripts_admin_address %>
#
# The following example will show you a configuration to do the following changes:
#   * The folders cms, include and the file index.php will only be readable.
#   * The folders cms/plugins, cache, tmp, upload and the file config.php (nasty!)
#     will be writable by the webserver.
#
# --- start example ---
# only_webreadable:
#   - cms
#   - include
#   - index.php
# web_writable:
#   - cms/plugins
#   - cache
#   - tmp
#   - upload
#   - config.php
# --- end example ---
#
# by default we do nothing
